* TODO Keyboard & mouse movement
** Keyboard movement
Sort of implemented. However, not relative to player direction yet.
*** DONE Move relative to eye direction

*** DONE Strafing

Set glfwSetInputMode(window, GLFW_CURSOR, GLFW_CURSOR_DISABLED) and
set a callback with glfwSetCursorPosCallback(window, cursor_pos_callback).

GLFW_CURSOR_DISABLED hides the cursor and continually recenters it,
and cursor_pos_callback is a function of type Window -> Double -> Double -> IO ().

** TODO Use NetWire (or some other FRP)
That's the better way to handle the state, for sure.
Keep it dumb and simple for now tho.


** TODO Use quaternions; solve gimball lock
Future problem!



* DONE Texture loading with SOIL

SOIL is bad. Use JuicyPixels instead.

Should be simple? Potentially tricky part is translating from Vector
to whatever GL expects (Ptr CUInt?). Should be interesting enough.

* TODO Model input/output (obj?)
While AssImp would be nice, I can't be bothered to deal with the FFI for now.
Just use one of the simple already existing OBJ libraries.


** TODO Reading - AssImp - FFI
** TODO Writing - bespoke? obj is simple enough (AssImp can do it too)
